Conflict Management:
In a District Planning Office, Aarav is a newly appointed Executive Engineer and works with Ms. Iqbal, a Senior Town Planner 
One morning, Aarav arrives with urgency — placing a file on her desk.
"I've outlined a new rollout plan for the housing layout. If we go through the usual committee layers, we’ll lose three months. I say we act now — file it directly with the Commissioner."
Ms. Iqbal looks up slowly, meets his urgency with calm silence. 
She takes the file, skims it, and says simply, "It’s well thought through." 
She doesn’t rush. She doesn’t agree or disagree. She simply makes space.
This is the energy of Sva-artha — self-interest.
Not selfishness — but the deep human need to achieve, to act independently, to leave a mark.
Aarav wants movement, impact, results. His urgency is not wrong — it’s a reflection of his inner drive for autonomy and achievement.
But when Sva-artha is not seen or met, it can turn into impatience… even conflict.

Aarav waits for pushback. None comes. Only her quiet attention. The room feels still.
"You don’t think it’s too aggressive?" he asks. 
Ms. Iqbal places the file gently on the desk.
"I think it’s bold. Let’s bring it to the review table tomorrow morning — with space for discussion."
She offers no control. No resistance. Just a slow, balanced path forward.
"You’re okay with the risk?" he asks.
She pauses, then nods lightly.
"I’m okay with clarity. We’ll surface it, together." 
Aarav leaves, file in hand. His pace is slower now. Not subdued — but steadier.
Sometimes, ambition comes in like a wave.
It doesn’t need to be stopped — just met with still water.
That’s Upeksha. Not passivity, not withdrawal — but presence that doesn’t get pulled in.
Through her quiet steadiness, Ms. Iqbal lets Aarav find his own balance.
Not by telling him — but by being.

Let’s pause and reflect
1.	Can you recall a moment where you didn’t react — and your stillness shifted the energy in the room?
2.	How can you embody steadiness when someone brings heat, urgency, or pressure?
3.	What does it take to not take sides in conflict — while still offering direction?







Mentoring and inspiring others:
Setting: A rural district education office, late evening.
[Visuals: A young IAS officer, Anita, is reviewing reports, frustrated. A school principal walks out after a tense conversation. Her senior mentor, Mr. Bhattacharya, notices her mood and approaches.]

Meet Anita.
A young IAS officer, posted in a rural district. She’s driven, passionate, deeply committed to improving public education.

She’s brought fresh energy into the system — auditing midday meals, holding teachers accountable, tracking learning outcomes.
Everywhere she goes, she pushes for higher standards.

But not everyone is ready for her pace.
One afternoon, after a tense meeting, a school principal walks away shaking his head.

"Madam, we’ve been running this school for 20 years this way. These new apps and metrics — they’re not practical."

Anita replies firmly, "Change is never convenient. But it’s necessary — for the children."
The conversation ends in silence. Anita feels drained, frustrated.

That evening, as she sits at her desk, her mentor Mr. Bhattacharya walks in quietly, carrying two cups of tea.
He places one by her side.

"Still at it?" he asks gently.

Anita exhales, tired. "They’re just not getting it, sir. We’re offering tools, support, data… and all I hear is resistance. It’s exhausting."

Mr. Bhattacharya leans back, thoughtful.
"Anita, do you remember your first month here?"

She pauses, nods. "Yes… I was overwhelmed. It felt like everything was broken."

"And yet, you found your footing," he says softly. "Because people gave you space — your CEO, the peon who showed you the files, the teacher who helped translate. They didn’t push. They welcomed you."

Anita smiles faintly. "True. I didn’t even know where to sit in my first meeting."

This — is Maitri. Loving-kindness.
Not indulgence, not softness — but the understanding that people grow when they feel respected and seen.
Maitri turns urgency into invitation.

Mr. Bhattacharya adds, "Change doesn’t always start with a directive. Sometimes it begins with a cup of tea… and a question like, ‘What would make this easier for you?’"

Anita reflects quietly. "I’ve been charging ahead… maybe too fast. I want results, but I need their trust too."

Her mentor smiles. "Your fire is needed. Just don’t forget — warmth can light the way better than heat."

The next morning, Anita meets the same principal again. But this time, in the school courtyard.

"Sir," she says gently, "I’d like to understand what’s made the app difficult. Maybe we can co-design something more usable."

The principal looks surprised, then nods. They begin walking together toward the classrooms.

Anita still leads with motivation. But now, it’s tempered with empathy.
That’s Sva-prerana, guided by Maitri — a fire that warms, not burns.

Let’s pause and reflect:
Narrator:
Think of a time when your own drive or passion was met with resistance.
•	How did you respond?
•	What would it look like to lead in that moment with Maitri — loving-kindness?

Giving and receiving feedback constructively:
Meet Ramesh.
A senior administrative officer in the District Health Office.
For decades, he has run the office with structure, order, and discipline.
His systems are proven, efficient — the backbone of daily operations.

This is Sva-raksha — the instinct to preserve what is stable and reliable.
But sometimes, stability can build invisible walls.

One morning, Neha, a young junior officer, walks up to his desk.
Her voice is cautious.
"Sir, I’ve been reworking the reporting format to reduce duplication for field workers. Could I show you a draft?"

Without looking up, Ramesh replies,
"Neha, I appreciate the effort, but let’s stick with what works. We’ve had this format for years — it’s approved, it’s complete. Please don’t overthink."

Neha nods silently and leaves.
Her face shows disappointment, though she says nothing.

Later that day, Ms. Anasuya, the Joint Director and Ramesh’s mentor, steps into his office with a warm smile.
She sits across from him and begins gently.

"Rameshji, I just saw Neha. She looked a little deflated. May I share a thought?"

Ramesh listens politely. "Of course, madam. I just didn’t want to create confusion by changing what already works."

Ms. Anasuya leans forward, her tone soft but steady.
"I know your intent is to protect what functions well. That’s your strength. But what if someone new brings an idea that could reduce friction for others — and you don’t even get to hear it fully?"

She continues,
"It’s not about changing everything. It’s about making space for effort, even when it’s imperfect. It’s about showing people that their voice matters — especially when they’re still gathering the courage to speak."

Ramesh pauses, thoughtful.

This is Karuna — compassion.
The ability to respect another’s need for stability, while gently inviting them to step into the unfamiliar.
It challenges without disrespect.
It supports without control.
It creates space for growth, without taking away someone’s ground.

The next morning, Ramesh walks over to Neha’s desk, holding her file.
His voice is gentler now.
"Neha, I went through your notes again. You’ve really thought this through. Let’s try your format in the weekly pilot and see how it supports the team."

Neha looks surprised — and relieved.
Her confidence returns as she smiles. "Thank you, sir. I’ll be ready to support the rollout."

This is Karuna in action.
Not a grand gesture, but the quiet strength to stay present, to listen deeply, and to offer challenge with care.

When Ramesh’s value for Sva-raksha is met with Ms. Anasuya’s compassion, it transforms from mere protection into mindful guardianship — one that honours Ramesh’s stability, yet leaves room for him to grow.

Let’s pause and reflect:
•	When someone resists change, do you only see it as rigidity — or do you pause to understand what they might be trying to protect?
•	How might you offer feedback that honours someone’s need for stability — while still inviting them to explore new possibilities?


Influencing and Negotiation:

In the Ministry of Environment, a working group prepares a key proposal on climate adaptation and local water governance.
At the centre of it all is Sonal — a Joint Secretary, composed and perceptive, known for nurturing talent.

On her desk lies a thick draft policy.
She reads through it carefully, her eyes pausing at one section.
Kiran’s section on community-based water rights.
Balanced. Well-grounded. Bold.

Sonal reaches for the intercom.
"Can you ask Kiran to step in for a few minutes?"

Moments later, Kiran enters.
Kiran is a technical consultant, principled and quietly driven.
He avoids politics and self-promotion, guided by Aatma-siddhi — values of purpose, detachment, and the greater good.

Sonal gestures to a chair, offering him tea.
Her tone is warm.
"I’ve gone through the draft. You’ve brought in a fresh, grounded approach — especially the governance model. Well done."

Kiran, responds softly.
"Thank you, ma’am. It’s a team effort."

Sonal smiles.
"It is. But your clarity stands out."

She continues.
"I’d like you to present this at the upcoming forum. You’ve done the groundwork — you should represent it."

Kiran shifts slightly, hesitant.
"To be honest Ma’am, I’d prefer to stay in the background. My role is more back-end. I’m not keen on visibility. I’d be happy to brief whoever’s presenting."

Sonal listens carefully.
Her voice is thoughtful, steady.
"I understand. You want the work to make an impact — not necessarily to be the face of it. That’s admirable, Kiran."

Kiran nods quietly.

She leans in, her tone gentle but firm.
"I’m not asking you to step forward for visibility. I’m asking because your voice carries integrity. And in a room full of positions and agendas, integrity is what will stand out."

She pauses, 
"It gives me joy to see someone like you represent us. You bring sincerity and depth, and that deserves to be heard."

Kiran looks moved. Not pressured — but respected.
After a moment, he replies,
"Alright, ma’am. If it helps strengthen the proposal and serves the purpose… I’ll do it."

Sonal nods, "That’s all I was hoping for."

Narrator:
Sometimes, leadership is about recognising what already shines quietly.

Kiran values the work, not the credit. That is Aatma-siddhi.
And Sonal doesn’t override his humility — she honours it.

She influences not through pressure, but through Mudita — joy in another’s contribution.

This is the kind of leadership that strengthens public service.
Calm. Respectful. And deeply effective.

Let’s pause and reflect
1.	Do you recognise people on your team who bring quiet, purpose-driven strength?
2.	Can you find joy in encouraging them — not for credit, but because they matter?
3.	How can you influence without overpowering — especially when working with sincere, value-driven colleagues?
